Ayyyyyyy! Update time baby!!! This one so far is the longest update of all i took me a while and i added a bunch of stuff. the new/changed stuff is
-changed circles in zero gravity to cubes
-added a board with players names that (sometimes) works
-replaced flashlight light with lightsaber (flashlight would cause lag if a lot of people had it on)
-added COLORS!!! check out the boarded up zone for the new colors. Also the moderators have found a way to travel through these new vents.
-new (nerd stuff) inverse kinematics system so the arms don't freak out anymore over time.
-buying cosmetics actually works now, so be smart on what you buy.
-new music in mines
-added a filter so people can not put their names as very bad things
-made ban evasion harder to do (please dont do it)
and some other small tweaks and fixes that dont need to be talked about. Anyway, feel free to report people in
our discord (https://discord.gg/capuchin) See ya!
